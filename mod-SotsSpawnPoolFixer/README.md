Fixes wrong dlc spawn pools being chosen on most stages or no DLC content at all on some stages.

Hopoo Games implementation for DLC spawn pools does not work properly with multiple DLCs.\
Gearbox, didn't fix this.

This leads to very often stages not being able to spawn SotV or SotS interactables or monsters.\
Stages either have a 33% or 50% chance to not spawn with Sotv or Sots content. Depending on the stage.\
Some stages in vanilla do always have Sotv + Sots content however.\
This notably makes Void items and Halcyon Shrines rarer than intended. Not by too much but a noticeable amount.

This is also the reason why sometimes Magma Worms are on Sky Meadow, or Elder Lemurians instead of Gups in Grove.

All non sots Stage 3s,4s,5s also just can't spawn Sots interactables because, they just gave up half way through adding them, (I guess??)

This mod also makes Titanic Plains and Distant Roost not twice as common as other stage 1s.\
This is caused by Plains & Roost being in the stage pool twice, because they are 2 variants.\
Hopoo/Gearbox seem to change their mind often whether whether both variants should have a weight of 1 or a lower weight.\
They now have a weight of 0.75 so still 50% more common, the variants are quite different.


The following problems are fixed:
- Titanic Plains : Never uses Sotv+Sots monster pool (Loop Halcyonite)
- Distant Roost 2 : Never uses ANY DLC spawn pool
- Siphoned Forest : Never uses Sotv+Sots monster pool (Loop Scorch Wurm)
- Verdant Falls : Never uses Sotv+Sots monster pool (Children)
- Shattered Abodes : Has Stage 1 Wild Printers. Unlike other stage 1s
- Disturbed Impact : Uses Titanic Plains interactables instead of the correct pool
- Wetland Aspect : Never uses ANY DLC spawn pool
- Aphelian Sanctuary : Never uses Sotv+Sots monster pool (No differences)
- Rallypoint Delta : Never uses Sotv+Sots interactables pool (Halc shrines)
- Scorched Acres : Never uses Sotv+Sots interactables pool (Halc shrines)
- Sulfur Pools : Never uses Sotv+Sots interactables pool (Halc shrines)
- Treeborn Colony : Spawns Radar Scanners even after unlocking log.
- Golden Dieback : Uses Treeborn interactables instead of the correct pool
- Golden Dieback : Uses Treeborn monsters instead of the correct pool. (Meant to have SCU, Imps)
- Abyssal Depths : Never uses Sotv+Sots interactables pool (Halc shrines)
- Sirens Call : Never uses Sotv+Sots interactables pool (Halc shrines)
- Sundered Grove : Never uses Sotv+Sots interactables pool (Halc shrines)
- Sky Meadow : Never uses Sotv+Sots interactables pool (Halc shrines)
