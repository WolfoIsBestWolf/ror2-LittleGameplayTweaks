##
This mod makes the game easier.\
Making the stages interactables credits more equal and having less credits spent on bad interactables adds up to more interactables. Not too many but probably a noticible difference.

Report bugs to @Wolfo.wolfo in the Risk of Rain 2 discord or RoR2 Modding discord.\
If you're reporting a bug that isn't something obvious include the log file.

### Every player needs this mod installed.
