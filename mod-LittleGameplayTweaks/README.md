#
Making the stages interactables credits more equal and having less credits spent on bad interactables adds up to more items. Not too many but maybe a noticible difference.

But mod also makes game a bit harder in cerain areas so evens out.


More Void Locust spotlight, More varied Eclipse, and some other stuff it's nice.
