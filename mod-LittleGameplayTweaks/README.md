This mod should work entirely fine if only the Host has the mod.

Everything configurable ingame via RiskOfOptions.

## Spawn Pools
A couple enemies have been moved or replaced to encourage enemy diversity.
- Bison instead of Greater Wisp on Siphoned Forest
- Grovetender instead of Stone Titan on Sundered Grove
- Solus Control Unit instead of Clay Dunestrider on Rallypoint Delta
- Ingame Config can tell you the details.
- Every stage will have at least 1 enemy addition on loops.

Gup family event now spawns Geep & Gip too\
Parent family event now spawns Grandparent & Children too\
Family Event distribution is more varied.

Mili-Printers, Cleansing Pools and Equipment Drones are a bit more common\
Shrine of Order & TC-280 will spawn on some additional stages.

Reduces Credits cost of:
- Shrine of Blood, Combat, Order, Healing, Shaping, Lunar Chest, Void Potential, TC-280.
- Child, Parents, Grandparents, Greater Wisps, Void Reavers

## Monsters, Elites
Mending Healing Core now increases stats with level is generally a bit tougher.

Twisted Elites : 
- No longer have a 10s cooldown on their main ability,
- Them getting hit now also charges the ability
- Projectile can no longer be killed
- Projectile inflicts 5s of Skills Disabled instead of 420s of Lunar Ruin.
- - Should make them actually threatening like Malachite

Overloading Worms projectiles leave behind Overloading Bombs

Aquaduct Elder Lemurians now activate their Bands & scale with difficulty.

Void Devastator now immune to Freeze and Void Implosions.

Elite XI's spawn elite Alphas. (no bonus stats, matching other minion bosses)

Twisted Scav & Voidling have slightly less damage scaling.\
Twisted Scav special scaling no longer counts 0 players.

## Stages

Interactable Credits :
- Titanic Plains & Distant Roost : Slight bump to balance against new Stages 1s having many credits.
- Abandoned Aquaduct : Scales more logically in multiplayer.
- Siren's Call & Sundered Grove : Small flat credits boost to balance against Depths flat credits boost.
 
Stages 1,2,3 will spawn with slightly more monsters on them so there's more to do.

Stage 5 has a guaranteed Void Portal so Void Locust & Voidling can be used as a proper Mithrix alternative.

The Bazaar has a third Lunar Seer. Because we keep getting more stages.

Gilded Coast will have some extra shrines.
 
Void Fields Cells now charge faster\
	- (40s for the first 4, 50s for the next 4, 60 for the last).\
Cells now have a regenerating aura before activating them.

Deep Void Signal now takes 48 seconds instead of 60 & has a 30% larger Radius.

Pillar of Mass now charges 20% faster but can spawn 20% more monsters.

Moon Drop Ship and Void Fields Cell charge at full speed at just 1 player.


## Interactables
Printers, Scrappers & Shrines are faster / have less delay.


- Blood Purchases
	- No longer break Elixir, Transmitter & Watches.
- Shrines of Blood
	- Scale reward with time
- Halcyon Shrines
	- Shrines drain gold faster
	- Shrines Stone Golems HP no longer multiplied per player
	- May spawn Halcyonites instead of just Golems
- Shrine of Woods
	- Price reduced to 10/13/18/25$ (from 25/37/55)
	- Can be used a 4th time
- Shrine of the Mountain are a bit more common in solo.
- Gunner Turret price reduced to 25$
- TC-280 price reduced to 300$	 
- Void Seeds
- - Spawn slightly more enemies in general 
- - Spawn more enemies on loop
- - Likelier to spawn Void Devastator
- - Less credits wasted on barrels
- Void Potential Chests
- - Can contain any item 


## Looping 
Generally I wish to make Looping a bit more chaotic because it's rather boring.

Stages start with more monsters on loops.

Teleporters spawn more bosses per loop.\
Teleporter Boss HP scales with Loop and Stage clear count, so that it remains something exciting.

Every loop-stage completed raises the enemy level by 10, beyond the cap.

Every Stage 5 will spawn a Void Locust Portal.\
Stage 10 will spawn a Celestial Portal.
 
Tier 2 elites are cheaper. (30x instead of 36x)

Scavengers can be encountered as bosses and will have a random Boss item.\
Elite Scavengers will be given more items.

After Mithrix you can continue looping via a Portal at spawn.\
After Twisted Scavengers you also get a portal.

\
For people who don't like looping :
- Config for Scavs on Stage 4 & 5
- Config for Tier 2 Elites on Stage 5

## Survivors & Drones

Captain keeps his abilities in Hidden Realms.\
Captain gets a third beacon with Lysate Cell.

Huntress will use 2 Ballista Charges for 6 Shots with Lysate Cell.

Commando & Acrid M2s shoot out rapdily without needing to press each time.

Equipment Drones will fire their equipment as often as they can depending on the equipment. (ie Scanner, Jade Elephant)\
TC-280 will have Adaptive Armor & resistance to AoE attacks.


## Other
### Eclipse
Spawns Squid Turrets and Ghosts at full health
- The half health makes these items last half as long which isnt fun because they're already bad.
Unlocks next Eclipse level if you leave Commencement
- So dying to Voidling still counts.
- So that using the Loop Portal still counts.
Allows normally disabled content :
	- Choice of most Artifacts. (excludes Command, Rebirth)\
	- Moment Fractured and entering Moment Whole without Beads.\
	- Void Locust access\
	- Bulwarks Ambry access

#
### General
Elite Equipment have a 1/1600 chance of dropping (instead of 1/4000).\
Boss items are now a 20% chance to drop. (instead of 15%)



#
Making the stages interactables credits more equal and having less credits spent on bad interactables adds up to more items. Not too many but maybe a noticible difference.

But mod also makes game a bit harder in cerain areas so evens out.


More Void Locust spotlight, More varied Eclipse, and some other stuff it's nice.
