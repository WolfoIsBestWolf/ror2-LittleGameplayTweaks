This mod should work entirely fine if only the Host has the mod.

Everything configurable ingame via RiskOfOptions. (Tho some settings may require a restart)

## Spawn Pools
A couple enemies have been moved or replaced to encourage enemy diversity.
- Bison instead of Greater Wisp on Siphoned Forest
- Grovetender instead of Stone Titan on Sundered Grove
- Solus Control Unit instead of Clay Dunestrider on Rallypoint Delta
- Ingame Config can tell you the details.
- Every stage will have at least 1 enemy addition on loops.

 
Family Event distribution is more varied.

Mili-Printers, Cleansing Pools and Emergency Drones are a bit more common.\
Shrine of Order & TC-280, Emergency Drones will spawn on some additional stages.

## Monsters, Elites


- Mending Healing Core now levels up.
- Various desctructible projectiles now level up. (ie Vagrant Bomb)
- Twisted Elites:
	- Orb can no longer be destroyed
	- Cooldown shortened to 1s (from 10s)
		- *Their ability is too easy to be countered and goes away for too long.*
- Solus Extractors
	- No longer targets drones.
- Void Devestator now immune to freeze
		- *Like other bosses*
- Twisted Scavengers scale in multiplayer
		- *Most likely a bug*
 
Overloading Worms projectiles leave behind Overloading Bombs

Aquaduct Elder Lemurians now activate their Bands & scale with difficulty.
 
 
## Stages

Credits Bump:
- Titanic Plains & Distant Roost : Slight bump to balance against new Stages 1s having many credits.
- Abandoned Aquaduct : Flat -60 instead of 220 credits, to scale more logically in multiplayer.
- Siren's Call & Sundered Grove : Small flat credits boost to balance against Depths flat credits boost.
 
Stages 1,2,3 will spawn with slightly more monsters on them so there's more to do.

Stage 5 has a guaranteed Void Portal so Void Locust & Voidling can be used as a proper Mithrix alternative.

The Bazaar has a third Lunar Seer. Because we keep getting more stages.

Gilded Coast will have some extra shrines.
 
 
Moon Drop Ship and Void Fields Cell charge at full speed at just 1 player.


## Interactables
Printers, Scrappers & Shrines are faster / have less delay.


- Shrine of Order
	- Costs far less to spawn.
- Shrine of Woods
	- Price reduced to 20/20/20$ (from 25/37/55) 
- Shrines of Blood
	- Scales reward slightly with time
- Halcyon Shrines
	- Shrines drain gold faster
	- Shrines Stone Golems HP no longer multiplied per player
	- May spawn Halcyonites instead of just Golems
- Void Seeds
- - Spawn slightly more enemies
- - Spawn more enemies on loop
- - Likelier to spawn Void Devastator
- Void Potential Chests
- - Can contain any item 


## Looping 
Generally I wish to make Looping a bit more chaotic because it's rather boring.


Tier 2 elites are cheaper. (30x instead of 36x)

Stages start with more monsters on loops.

Teleporters spawn more bosses per loop.\
Teleporter Boss HP scales with Loop and Stage clear count, so that it remains something exciting.
 
Every Stage 5 will spawn a Void Locust Portal.\
Stage 10 will spawn a Celestial Portal.
 


Scavengers can be encountered as bosses and will have a random Boss item.\
Elite Scavengers will be given more items.
 
 
## Survivors & Drones

Captain keeps his abilities in Hidden Realms.\
Captain gets to have three beacons with Lysate Cell.

Huntress will use 2 Ballista Charges for 6 Shots with Lysate Cell.

Commando & Acrid M2s shoot out rapdily without needing to press each time. (Like pre SotV)

Equipment Drones will be able to fire some equipment without enemies nearby. (ie Scanner, Jade Elephant)\
 

## Other
### Eclipse
Spawns Squid Turrets and Ghosts at full health
- The half health makes these items last half as long which isnt fun because they're already bad.
Unlocks next Eclipse level if you leave Commencement
- So dying to Voidling still counts.
- So that using the Loop Portal still counts.
Allows normally disabled content :
	- Moment Fractured and entering Moment Whole without Beads.\
	- Void Locust access\
	- Bulwarks Ambry access

#
### General
Elite Equipment have a 1/1600 chance of dropping (instead of 1/4000).\
Boss items are now a 20% chance to drop. (instead of 15%)



#
Making the stages interactables credits more equal and having less credits spent on bad interactables adds up to more items. Not too many but maybe a noticible difference.

But mod also makes game a bit harder in cerain areas so evens out.


More Void Locust spotlight, More varied Eclipse, and some other stuff it's nice.
