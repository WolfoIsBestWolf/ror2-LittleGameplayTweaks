Wish Seekers of the Storm had more loop variants so I tried my hand at it.

Config to make them and official variants happen pre-loop.\
Or make them chance based on loops.\
You can turn off individual variants if you dislike them.

The loop variants are meant to have enemy changes, but this will remain part of [LittleGameplayTweaks](https://thunderstore.io/package/Wolfo/LittleGameplayTweaks/).\
Viscious Falls and Disturbed Impact won't have Elder Lemurians or Void Reavers on stage 1.\
Variants might still have some gamelplay differences. (Such as the slowing tar river on Aquaduct)

No idea how this mod interacts with Stage Aesthetics or Cooler Stages.
