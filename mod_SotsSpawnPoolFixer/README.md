The following bugs are fixed:
```
- Distant Roost never spawning DLC1 interactables
- Scorched Acres never spawning DLC1 interactables

- Disturbed Impact  using Titanic Plains' interactables spawn pools

- Disturbed Impact  Radar Scanner being blocked by Titanic Plains Log. (Due to wrong spawn pool)
- Disturbed Impact  Radar Scanner being blocked by Shattered Abodes Log. (Correct spawn pool does not fix it)
- Treeborn Canopy   Radar Scanner being blocked by Aphelian Sanctuary Log.
- Golden Dieback    Radar Scanner being blocked by Aphelian Sanctuary Log.
- Helminth Hatchery Radar Scanner being blocked by Sky Meadows Log.

- Bulwarks Ambry 02  	Uses wrong Bulwarks Ambry monster spawn pool
- Shattered Abodes  	Has Stage 1 Overgrown Printers. Which Stage 1s are not meant to have.

- Aphelian Sanctuary not being able to spawn Lunar Buds & Halcyon Shrines, which still took credits.
-- Same applies for Simu-Sanctuary, Simu-Commencement & Void Locust.
-- Also relevant for Vultures & Hermit Crabs via Dissonance.
```

The other changes are not necessarily bugs and can be turned off.

SotV removing/replacing enemies might come back, might stay gone.\
People have been asking the devs about it a lot, they are aware of it.
 


```
Reduced weight of Titanic Plains and Distant Roost because they count as 2 stages.
-Vanilla counts as 2 weight, now counts as 1.5 weight.

Lunar Seers will no longer get Pre-Loop stage variants during loops.

ReAdded SotV removing some enemies, because the new enemies were seemingly meant as replacements.
If DLC1 is enabled :
- Jellyfish removed from Loop Titanic Plains : Replaced with Alpha Construct 
- Lemurian removed from Rallypoint Delta     : Replaced with Blind Vermin
- Lesser Wisp removed from Rallypoint Delta  : Replaced with Blind Pest
- Greater Wisp removed from Abyssal Depths   : Replaced with Gup
- Beetle removed from Sirens Call            : Replaced with Larva
- Lemurian removed from Sundered Grove       : Replaced with Larva
- Elder Lemurian removed from Sundered Grove : Replaced with Gup
-- Magma worm removed from Sky Meadows       : Replaced with XI Construct : (Off by default)
